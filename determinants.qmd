# Determinants and Invertibility in Linear Algebra

## Introduction

This study guide covers essential concepts about determinants in linear algebra, focusing on the effects of row operations on determinants and the relationship between a matrixâ€™s invertibility and its determinant.

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### Determinants of Square Matrices
::: {.callout-note}
**Definition**: The **determinant** of a square matrix $A$ is a scalar that provides information about the matrix's properties, such as invertibility and volume scaling factor. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is calculated as:
$\text{det}(A) = ad - bc \quad \text{for} \quad A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}.$
:::

#### Example
For $A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 5 \end{bmatrix}$, the determinant is:
$\text{det}(A) = (3 \times 5) - (4 \times 2) = 15 - 8 = 7.$

### Basic Properties of Determinants
The determinant of a matrix $A$ is:
- **Zero** if $A$ is not invertible.
- **Nonzero** if $A$ is invertible.

The determinant also changes in predictable ways with row operations, as detailed below.

## Effects of Row Operations on Determinants

### Row Operations and Determinant Effects
1. **Row Replacement**: Replacing one row with itself plus a multiple of another row leaves the determinant unchanged.
2. **Row Interchange**: Interchanging two rows of a matrix multiplies the determinant by \(-1\).
3. **Row Scaling**: Multiplying a row by a scalar $k$ scales the determinant by $k$.

#### Example
Consider $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ with $\text{det}(A) = -2$.
- **Row Replacement**: Replacing row 1 with $\text{row 1} + 3 \times \text{row 2}$ does not alter the determinant.
- **Row Interchange**: Swapping rows 1 and 2 changes the determinant to $2$.
- **Row Scaling**: Multiplying row 1 by $3$ changes the determinant to $-6$.

### Calculating Determinants Using Row Operations
Determinants can be computed by transforming the matrix to an upper triangular form via row operations. The determinant is then the product of the diagonal entries.

## Important Theorems

## Determinant Multiplication Theorem
For matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same size, $\text{det}(AB) = \text{det}(A) \times \text{det}(B)$.

## Invertibility and Determinants
A matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if $\text{det}(A) \neq 0$.

## Relationship Between Invertibility and Determinants

### Determinants as an Invertibility Criterion
If $\text{det}(A) = 0$, then:
- $A$ is **not invertible**.
- $A$ has linearly dependent rows or columns.
- The matrix $A$ maps volumes to zero, indicating a lack of full rank.

Conversely, if $\text{det}(A) \neq 0$, then $A$ is invertible, has linearly independent columns, and the transformation represented by $A$ is volume-preserving (up to a scaling factor).

#### Example
For $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$, $\text{det}(A) = (1)(6) - (2)(3) = 0$. Thus, $A$ is not invertible due to linearly dependent columns.

## Special Cases or Applications

### Determinants in Geometric Interpretation
The determinant of a transformation matrix represents the scaling factor for areas (in 2D) or volumes (in 3D) under the transformation. A determinant of zero implies that the transformation collapses the space into a lower dimension.

### Determinant of Triangular Matrices
For a triangular matrix, the determinant is the product of its diagonal entries. This property simplifies determinant calculations, especially after transforming a matrix to echelon form.

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1
Calculate the determinant of the matrix

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 5 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Solution
Using the formula $\text{det}(A) = ad - bc$:

$\text{det}(A) = (2 \times 3) - (5 \times 1) = 6 - 5 = 1$

Since $\text{det}(A) \neq 0$, $A$ is invertible.
:::

### Problem 2
Determine if the matrix $B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 4 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ is invertible using its determinant.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Solution
$\text{det}(B) = (0 \times 0) - (1 \times 4) = -4.$
Since $\text{det}(B) \neq 0$, $B$ is invertible.
