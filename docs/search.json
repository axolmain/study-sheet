In orthogonal projection, any vector \\vec{b} is decomposed into:\n- \\vec{b} = \\vec{p} + \\vec{e}, where \\vec{p} is in \\text{Col}(A) and \\vec{e} is orthogonal to \\text{Col}(A).\nExamples:\n\nExample:\nFor \\vec{u} = [1, 0] and \\vec{v} = [0, 1]:\n\n\\|\\vec{u}, \\vec{v} \\|= 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 0\n\nProblem 28:\nGiven: \\vec{y} is orthogonal to both \\vec{u} and \\vec{v}, i.e., \\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{u} = 0 and \\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0.\nTo Show: \\vec{y} is orthogonal to every \\vec{w} \\in \\text{Span}\\{\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}\\}.\nProof:\nAny vector \\vec{w} in \\text{Span}\\{\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}\\} can be written as a linear combination:\n\n\\vec{w} = a\\vec{u} + b\\vec{v}, \\quad \\text{where } a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\n Compute the dot product of \\vec{y} with \\vec{w}:\n\n\\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{w} = \\vec{y} \\cdot (a\\vec{u} + b\\vec{v}) = a(\\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{u}) + b(\\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{v})\n Since \\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{u} = 0 and \\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0:\n\n\\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{w} = a(0) + b(0) = 0\n Therefore, \\vec{y} is orthogonal to \\vec{w}.\nConclusion:\n\n\\vec{y} \\cdot \\vec{w} = 0 \\quad \\forall \\, \\vec{w} \\in \\text{Span}\\{\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}\\}\n Thus, \\vec{y} is orthogonal to every vector in \\text{Span}\\{\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}\\}.\nProblem 5:\nCompute \\left( \\dfrac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right) \\vec{v}.\nSolution:\nGiven \\vec{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} and \\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix}.\nFirst, compute \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{v}:\n\n\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (4)(4) + (6)(6) = 16 + 36 = 52\n Compute the scalar coefficient:\n\n\\dfrac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{8}{52} = \\dfrac{2}{13}\n Multiply by \\vec{v}:\n\n\\left( \\dfrac{2}{13} \\right) \\vec{v} = \\dfrac{2}{13} \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dfrac{8}{13} \\\\ \\dfrac{12}{13} \\end{bmatrix}\n Result:\n\n\\left( \\dfrac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right) \\vec{v} = \\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} \\dfrac{8}{13} \\\\ \\dfrac{12}{13} \\end{bmatrix}}\n Interpretation:\nThis result represents the projection of \\vec{u} onto \\vec{v}, which is an important concept in orthogonality and projections in vector spaces."

The key observation is that the homogeneous system has a null space of dimension 1, as all solutions are multiples of one nonzero solution. For the inhomogeneous system to have a solution for every choice of constants, the coefficient matrix must have full row rank (rank 5). However, since there are 6 unknowns, the rank cannot exceed 5, leaving one degree of freedom in the solution space. This means there may exist some choices of constants for which the system is inconsistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn statistical theory, a common requirement is that a matrix be of full rank.

This is only possible if the columns are linearly independent; otherwise, the rank would be less than n. If the columns are linearly dependent, at least one column can be expressed as a linear combination of others, reducing the rank. Therefore, full rank requires that the columns be linearly independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3Blue1Brown - Essence of Linear Algebra (YouTube)\nKhan Academy - Linear Algebra (YouTube)\nMIT OpenCourseWare - Linear Algebra"

Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system does not necessarily have a solution for every possible choice of constants. The key observation is that the homogeneous system has a null space of dimension 1, as all solutions are multiples of one nonzero solution. For the inhomogeneous system to have a solution for every choice of constants, the coefficient matrix must have full row rank (rank 5). However, since there are 6 unknowns, the rank cannot exceed 5, leaving one degree of freedom in the solution space. This means there may exist some choices of constants for which the system is inconsistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn statistical theory, a common requirement is that a matrix be of full rank. That is, the rank should be as large as possible. Explain why an m \\times n matrix with more rows than columns has full rank if and only if its columns are linearly independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAn m \\times n matrix A (where m &gt; n) has full rank when \\text{rank}(A) = n, which implies that the columns span an n-dimensional space. This is only possible if the columns are linearly independent; otherwise, the rank would be less than n. If the columns are linearly dependent, at least one column can be expressed as a linear combination of others, reducing the rank. Therefore, full rank requires that the columns be linearly independent."

\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = (\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}).\n\nExpand: \n(\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u} - 2(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}) + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}.\n\nSimilarly: \n\\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = (\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{u} + 2(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}) + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}.\n\n\nThus: \n\\|\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 - 2(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}), \\\\\n\\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 + 2(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}).\n\nOrthogonality case: If \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0: \n\\|\\mathbf{u} \\pm \\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\nFor \\mathbf{u} = [1, 2] and \\mathbf{v} = [4, 6]: \n\\begin{aligned}\nd(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}) &= \\|\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}\\| = \\sqrt{(1 - 4)^2 + (2 - 6)^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} \\\\\n&= 5\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition:\nVectors \\mathbf{u} and \\mathbf{v} are orthogonal if: \n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0.\n\nAn orthogonal set of vectors is a collection in which every pair of distinct vectors is mutually perpendicular (their dot product is zero).\nPythagorean Theorem in \\mathbb{R}^n:\nTwo vectors \\mathbf{u} and \\mathbf{v} are orthogonal if and only if: \n\\|\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthogonality underpins important decompositions of vector spaces.\n\nIf \\mathbf{u} is in the null space of A, it is orthogonal to every vector in the column space of A.\n\nMore generally, we have orthogonal complements: if V is a vector space, it can often be decomposed into the direct sum of a subspace and its orthogonal complement: \nV = \\text{Col}(A) \\oplus \\text{Nul}(A^T).\n\nOrthogonality is crucial for defining orthogonal projections, which “drop” a vector onto a subspace without introducing any component orthogonal to that subspace.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\nFor \\mathbf{u} = [1, 0] and \\mathbf{v} = [0, 1]: \n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = (1)(0) + (0)(1) = 0.\n These vectors are orthogonal (standard unit vectors along coordinate axes).\nProblem 28:\nIf \\mathbf{y} is orthogonal to both \\mathbf{u} and \\mathbf{v}, then \\mathbf{y} is orthogonal to every vector in \\text{Span}\\{\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}\\}.\nProof Outline: Any \\mathbf{w} in the span can be written as a\\mathbf{u}+b\\mathbf{v}. Since \\mathbf{y}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0 and \\mathbf{y}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=0, it follows that \\mathbf{y}\\cdot\\mathbf{w}=0.\nProblem 5 (Projection):\nGiven \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix}-1 \\\\ 2\\end{bmatrix} and \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}4 \\\\ 6\\end{bmatrix}, compute: \n\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}}\\right)\\mathbf{v}.\n\n\nWe found \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = 52 and \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = 8: \n\\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}} = \\frac{8}{52} = \\frac{2}{13}.\n Thus: \n\\left(\\frac{2}{13}\\right)\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\tfrac{8}{13}\\\\[6pt]\\tfrac{12}{13}\\end{bmatrix}.\n\n\nThis vector is the projection of \\mathbf{u} onto \\mathbf{v}, a fundamental concept in orthogonal decompositions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor matrices, orthogonality is defined using an inner product known as the Frobenius inner product. For two matrices A and B of the same dimensions: \n\\langle A, B \\rangle_F = \\text{trace}(A^T B) = \\sum_{i,j} a_{ij}b_{ij}.\n\nDefinition:\nMatrices A and B are orthogonal (under the Frobenius inner product) if: \n\\langle A, B \\rangle_F = 0.\n\nRelation to Vector Spaces:\n- The concept of orthogonality extends from vectors to matrices by considering the space of all m\\times n matrices as a vector space over \\mathbb{R}.\n- Orthogonality of matrices is equivalent to the orthogonality of their vectorized forms (flattening the matrix into a long vector).\nExample:\nFor \nA = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix},\n we have: \n\\langle A, B \\rangle_F = (1)(0) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (0)(1) = 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, we have:\n\nIntroduced the concept of the inner product as a generalization of the familiar dot product, allowing for the definition of angles, lengths, and orthogonality in vector spaces.\nDefined the norm of a vector and showed how it leads to the notion of distance.\nExplored how orthogonality underpins many fundamental results in linear algebra, including projections, decompositions of vector spaces, and relationships between column spaces and null spaces.\nExtended the idea of inner products and orthogonality to matrices via the Frobenius inner product.\n\nThese concepts set the stage for more advanced topics like orthogonal projections, orthonormal bases, and least-squares solutions, all of which rely critically on the notions introduced here."
