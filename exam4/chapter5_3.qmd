In linear algebra, diagonality refers to the process of diagonalizing a matrix, which is a similarity transformation that produces a diagonal matrix. A diagonal matrix is a square matrix where all elements are zero except for those on the main diagonal.

# Matrix 

$$
A = P D P^{-1}
\\
\text{For } k \geq 1 \text{,}
\\
A^k = P D^{k} P^{-1} 
$$

## Theorem 5
An $n ~ \text{x} ~ n$ matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if and only if $A$ has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors.

AKA

$A$ is diaganolizable if and only if there are enough eigenvectors to form a basis of $\real^n$ (thus forming the eigenvecotr basis of $\real^n$)

## Theorem 7

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix with distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_p$:

1. **Dimension of eigenspaces**: For each eigenvalue $\lambda_k$, the dimension of its eigenspace is less than or equal to its algebraic multiplicity.

2. **Diagonalizability**: $A$ is diagonalizable if and only if:
   - The sum of the dimensions of all eigenspaces equals $n$, and
   - The characteristic polynomial of $A$ splits into distinct linear factors (no repeated roots in irreducible form).

3. **Eigenvector basis**: If $A$ is diagonalizable, the union of bases of all eigenspaces forms an eigenvector basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$.

# Diagonalization theorem (5) steps
How to find $PDP^-1$:

1. Find eigenvalues of $A$.
    * $det(A-\lambda I) = 0$
        * if $< n$ are found, then $A$ cannot be diagonalized.
2. Find n linearly independent eigenvectors of $A$.
    * $\vec{v_n} = (A-\lambda I)x = 0$ where $\lambda$ are the ones found in **Step 1**
3. Construct $P$ from the vectors found in **Step 2**
    * $P= [\vec{v_1}, ... , \vec{v_n}]$
4. Construct $D$ from eigenvalues found in **Step 1**
    * $D = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_n \end{bmatrix}$
5. Validate $A$, $D$, and $P$
    * $AP = PD$ or $A = PDP^{-1}$
