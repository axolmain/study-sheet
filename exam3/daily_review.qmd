# Core Vector Space Concepts

## Vector Space Definition & Properties
- A vector space is a set $V$ with two operations: addition and scalar multiplication, satisfying axioms like associativity, distributivity, and the existence of zero and additive inverses.

## Subspaces
- Three Key Properties: 
  1. Closed under addition ($\vec{u} + \vec{v} \in H$).
  2. Closed under scalar multiplication ($c\vec{u} \in H$).
  3. Contains the zero vector ($\vec{0} \in H$).
- Common Examples: Null space, column space, solution spaces to homogeneous equations.

## Linear Independence & Dependence
- Definition: A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set is a linear combination of the others.
- Common Mistake: Confusing dependence with spanning.

## Spanning Sets
- A set spans $V$ if every element in $V$ can be written as a linear combination of the set.

## Basis
- A basis is a linearly independent spanning set.

## Dimension
- Defined as the number of vectors in any basis for $V$.

# Fundamental Spaces of Matrices

## Null Space
- Definition: Set of all solutions to $A\mathbf{x} = 0$.
- Computation: Solve $A\mathbf{x} = 0$ via row reduction.

## Column Space
- Definition: Span of the column vectors of a matrix.
- Finding Basis: Use pivot columns in RREF.

## Row Space
- Definition: Span of the row vectors of a matrix.

## Rank-Nullity Theorem
- $\text{Rank}(A) + \text{Nullity}(A) = \text{Number of columns of } A$.

# Essential Matrix Operations

## Matrix Multiplication
- Associative but not commutative. Common mistake: Mixing these properties.

## Linear Transformations
- Defined by matrix actions $T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$.

## Elementary Row Operations
- Used for Gaussian elimination and finding RREF.

## Row Reduction (RREF)
- Steps: Eliminate lower triangle, scale pivots, eliminate above pivots.

## Practice Problems
1. Compute the null space and column space of a given matrix.
2. Prove that a given set is a subspace.
3. Find a basis and dimension for a vector space.
