# Linear Algebra: Key Terms and Relationships

## Quick Reference: Equivalent Terms

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
## Dimension = Rank = Size
- Dimension of a vector space = Number of vectors in any basis
- Rank of a matrix = Number of pivot columns
- Size of a span = Number of linearly independent vectors
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
## Span = Range = Image
- Span of vectors = All possible linear combinations
- Range of a transformation = Output vectors
- Image of a matrix = Column space
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
## Kernel = Null Space = Solution Space
- Kernel of transformation = Vectors that map to zero
- Null space of matrix = Solutions to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$
- Solution space of homogeneous system = Null space
:::

## Core Concepts and Their Relationships

### Vector Spaces
::: {.callout-important}
A vector space is a set with two operations:
1. Vector addition
2. Scalar multiplication

That satisfy certain axioms (closure, associativity, etc.)
:::

#### Key Relationships:
- Every vector space has a basis
- Dimension = Number of vectors in any basis
- Subspaces inherit properties from parent space
- $\dim(\text{subspace}) \leq \dim(\text{parent space})$

### Matrices and Their Spaces

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Row Space
- Span of row vectors
- $\dim(\text{row space}) = \text{row rank}$
- Row operations don't change row space

## Column Space
- Span of column vectors
- $\dim(\text{column space}) = \text{column rank}$
- Image of the matrix transformation

## Null Space
- Solutions to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$
- $\dim(\text{null space}) = \text{nullity}$
- Kernel of the matrix transformation
:::

#### Important Connections:
1. Row rank = Column rank = Rank of matrix
2. Number of pivot columns = Rank
3. Number of free variables = Nullity

### Fundamental Theorems and Their Implications

::: {.callout-tip}
## Rank-Nullity Theorem
For an $m \times n$ matrix:
$\text{rank} + \text{nullity} = n$ (number of columns)

**Implications:**
- More columns than rows → guaranteed null space
- Full column rank → trivial null space
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Row-Column Rank Theorem
Row rank = Column rank

**Implications:**
- Can find rank by counting pivot rows OR pivot columns
- Maximum rank is min(rows, columns)
:::

## Visual Summary of Relationships

### Matrix Properties
```
dim(row space) ──────┐
                     ├── all equal ── RANK
dim(column space) ───┘

RANK + NULLITY = NUMBER OF COLUMNS
```

### Vector Space Properties
```
BASIS ─── consists of ─── LINEARLY INDEPENDENT vectors
   │                           │
   └── that ─── SPANS ────────┘
   │
   └── number of vectors = DIMENSION
```

## Common Misconceptions and Clarifications

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Distinctions
1. Linear independence ≠ Spanning
   - A set can span without being linearly independent
   - A set can be linearly independent without spanning

2. Rank ≠ Number of Rows/Columns
   - Rank is ≤ min(rows, columns)
   - Equal only for full rank matrices

3. Zero vector ≠ Empty set
   - Zero vector is IN every vector space
   - Empty set is NOT a vector space
